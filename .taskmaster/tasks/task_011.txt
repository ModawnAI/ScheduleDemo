# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Enhanced Demo Features with Real-time Updates and Equipment Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive demo enhancement features including real-time data updates, demo scenario buttons, enhanced tooltips, equipment management system, and complete mobile responsiveness across all components.
# Details:
Create /components/demo/DemoEnhancementPanel.tsx with real-time update system using setInterval for dynamic job status, crew locations, and metrics changes. Implement /components/demo/ScenarioButtons.tsx with pre-configured data states for rush hour, weather emergency, equipment breakdown, and new contracts scenarios. Build /components/demo/EnhancedTooltips.tsx system with contextual help using bg-popover text-popover-foreground styling and Shadcn Tooltip components. Create /components/equipment/EquipmentManagement.tsx with asset tracking, maintenance schedules, and utilization metrics using chart color variables (chart-1 through chart-5). Implement /types/equipment.ts interfaces for Equipment, MaintenanceSchedule, and UtilizationMetrics. Add real-time data simulation functions with proper TypeScript interfaces and CSS variable integration. Create equipment dashboard with Shadcn Card components using bg-card text-card-foreground styling. Implement mobile-responsive design patterns with established breakpoint system. Add Lucide icons for equipment types and status indicators. Integrate with existing AppShell wrapper and maintain consistency with established configuration standards including PostCSS, Tailwind TypeScript config, and mandatory CSS variable usage.

# Test Strategy:
Test real-time updates function correctly with setInterval and proper cleanup on component unmount. Verify demo scenario buttons properly update application state with pre-configured data. Ensure enhanced tooltips render with proper Shadcn styling and accessibility compliance. Test equipment management system displays asset tracking, maintenance schedules, and utilization metrics correctly. Validate mobile responsiveness across all new components using established breakpoint system. Ensure all components follow 'new-york' Shadcn styling patterns and use mandatory CSS variables. Test TypeScript compilation with established configuration. Verify integration with existing AppShell wrapper and navigation system. Test accessibility features including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
