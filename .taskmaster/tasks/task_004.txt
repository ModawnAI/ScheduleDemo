# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Strategic Calendar View (Yearly/Monthly)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the strategic scheduling calendar with yearly and monthly views, populated with contract-based recurring services using the custom green/beige theme and color-coded visualization
# Details:
Create /components/StrategicCalendar.tsx using Shadcn Calendar component with custom CSS variables. Implement view toggle between yearly grid and monthly detail using bg-card text-card-foreground styling. Process contract data to distribute services evenly (e.g., '4 mows in Sept' = every 7-8 days). Use CPM AI brand colors: primary green for mowing, secondary green for fertilization, accent green for cleanup. Add hover tooltips with bg-popover text-popover-foreground styling. Implement click handlers with hover:bg-accent transitions. Use Framer Motion for smooth view transitions with the custom --radius variable.

# Test Strategy:
Verify calendar populates correctly from mock contract data with proper theme colors. Test view switching between yearly/monthly modes with smooth transitions. Validate color coding matches service types using CSS variables. Ensure click events properly capture selected dates with proper hover states.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Build Base Calendar Component with Shadcn and Custom Theme [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational calendar component in /components/StrategicCalendar.tsx using Shadcn UI calendar with custom CSS variables for the green/beige theme integration.
### Details:
Use bg-background text-foreground for base styling, border-border for calendar grid lines, and ensure proper integration with the custom --radius variable. Apply Geist font family and ensure dark mode compatibility.

## 2. Implement Yearly/Monthly View Toggle with Theme Styling [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Add functionality to switch between yearly grid and monthly detail views using custom theme colors and hover states.
### Details:
Style toggle buttons with bg-primary text-primary-foreground for active state and hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground for interactions. Use rounded-lg for consistent corner rounding.

## 3. Process and Distribute Contract Services with Brand Color Coding [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Parse contract data and algorithmically distribute recurring services using the CPM AI color palette for visual distinction.
### Details:
Map service types to brand colors: primary green for mowing, secondary green for fertilization, accent green for cleanup. Use CSS variables to ensure theme consistency and dark mode support.

Enhanced Service Color Mapping & Distribution Algorithm

**Implemented Brand Color Coding:**
- Mapped all 8 service types to CPM AI's green/beige theme using CSS variables
- Primary services (Weekly/Bi-weekly Mowing) use main green palette (bg-primary, bg-chart-3)
- Maintenance services (Fertilization, Irrigation) use secondary green palette (bg-chart-1, bg-chart-2)
- Seasonal services (Cleanup, Leaf Removal, etc.) use accent colors (bg-secondary, bg-accent, bg-chart-4, bg-chart-5)
- All colors follow the established CSS variable system for light/dark mode consistency

**Enhanced Service Distribution Algorithm:**
- Weekly services: Intelligent 7-day intervals starting from random day 1-7
- Bi-weekly services: 14-day intervals with proper spacing
- Other services: Even distribution with randomization + weekend avoidance for commercial services
- Avoids Sundays for most services except cleanup (more realistic scheduling)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Created getServiceTypeColor() function with full CSS class strings
- Created getServiceDotColor() function for calendar day indicators
- Updated CustomDayButton to use proper brand colors for service dots
- All colors use CSS variables ensuring theme consistency and dark mode support
- Maintains existing Framer Motion animations and responsive design

**Visual Result:**
- Calendar days show color-coded dots representing different service types
- Each service type has a distinct, brand-appropriate color from the green palette
- Colors automatically adapt to light/dark mode via CSS variables
- Service distribution appears more realistic and professional
