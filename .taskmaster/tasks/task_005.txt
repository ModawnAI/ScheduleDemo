# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create Static Daily Mission Control Dashboard UI with Complete Configuration Standards
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the daily dashboard interface with crew cards, job timelines, and metrics display using the established configuration standards including PostCSS, Tailwind TypeScript config, Shadcn 'new-york' style, and mandatory CSS variable usage
# Details:
Create /components/dashboard/DailyDashboard.tsx following AppShell wrapper pattern with bg-background text-foreground. Build CrewCard component using bg-card text-card-foreground border-border with Shadcn Card components. Create JobCard component with proper CSS variable integration and responsive design patterns. Implement MetricsPanel using chart-1 through chart-5 gradient system. Use established Geist font classes and responsive spacing patterns (space-y-4 md:space-y-6). Add themed placeholder for map area with bg-muted styling and proper container structure (max-w-7xl mx-auto).

# Test Strategy:
Test dashboard renders with hardcoded data using mandatory CSS variables. Verify all components follow 'new-york' Shadcn styling. Ensure metrics panel uses chart color variables correctly. Test responsive layout with established breakpoint system and verify TypeScript compilation with tailwind.config.ts.
