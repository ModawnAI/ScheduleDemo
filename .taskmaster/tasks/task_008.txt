# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Drag-and-Drop with Complete Configuration Standards and Shadcn Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Add interactive drag-and-drop functionality following established configuration standards with mandatory CSS variables, Shadcn 'new-york' styling, proper TypeScript interfaces, and Framer Motion integration
# Details:
Install @dnd-kit packages following established dependency management. Create DraggableJobCard component using bg-card text-card-foreground with proper TypeScript interfaces. Implement drop zones with hover:bg-accent styling and border-border highlights following Shadcn 'new-york' patterns. Add visual feedback using chart color variables (chart-1 through chart-5) with proper accessibility. Create handleJobMove function with bg-primary success states and proper error handling. Implement optimistic UI updates with established animation variants. Apply responsive design with established breakpoint system and container patterns.

# Test Strategy:
Test drag-and-drop compiles with established TypeScript configuration and uses mandatory CSS variables. Verify drop zones follow Shadcn 'new-york' styling patterns. Ensure visual feedback uses chart color variables correctly. Test responsive behavior with established breakpoint system and verify accessibility compliance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Configure Drag-and-Drop with Established Standards [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install @dnd-kit packages following established configuration standards with proper TypeScript integration and CSS variable setup.
### Details:
Install libraries with version compatibility for established build pipeline, configure DndContext with proper TypeScript interfaces, set up CSS variables for drag states, and ensure PostCSS pipeline processes drag-and-drop styles correctly.

## 2. Create DraggableJobCard with Mandatory CSS Variables and TypeScript [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop DraggableJobCard component following established component architecture with mandatory CSS variables and proper type safety.
### Details:
Use bg-card text-card-foreground for base styling, apply hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground states, implement transition-colors duration-200 for smooth interactions, ensure proper TypeScript interfaces, and integrate with Framer Motion using established animation variants.

## 3. Implement Drop Zones with Shadcn 'New-York' Styling [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Set up drop zones following established Shadcn configuration with 'new-york' style, CSS variables enabled, and proper accessibility.
### Details:
Use border-border for default state, hover:bg-accent for active zones, apply established border radius patterns, implement proper focus states for accessibility, ensure semantic HTML structure, and maintain WCAG compliance with proper contrast ratios.

## 4. Add Visual Feedback with Chart Color Variables [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Implement visual cues using established chart color system (chart-1 through chart-5) with proper accessibility and responsive behavior.
### Details:
Use chart-1 through chart-5 for active states, apply proper opacity values that maintain accessibility, implement smooth transitions with transition-colors duration-200, and ensure responsive behavior across established breakpoints.

## 5. Implement handleJobMove with Established CSS Variable Patterns [done]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Create handleJobMove function using mandatory CSS variables for state feedback with proper TypeScript type safety and error handling.
### Details:
Use bg-primary text-primary-foreground for success states, implement proper error styling with good contrast ratios, apply established loading patterns with bg-muted, ensure TypeScript type safety with proper interfaces, and maintain accessibility with semantic feedback.

## 6. Add Framer Motion Integration with Configuration Standards [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.5
### Description: Integrate Framer Motion animations following established animation variants and CSS variable integration with responsive behavior.
### Details:
Apply established animation variants, use CSS variables for transition states, implement responsive animation behavior across breakpoints, ensure smooth performance with established optimization patterns, and maintain accessibility with reduced motion preferences.
