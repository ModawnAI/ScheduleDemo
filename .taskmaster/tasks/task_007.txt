# Task ID: 7
# Title: Connect Calendar Navigation with Complete Configuration Standards and AppShell Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement routing logic following established configuration standards with mandatory CSS variables, proper TypeScript interfaces, and AppShell wrapper integration using Geist fonts and responsive patterns
# Details:
Create React Context following established TypeScript patterns with proper type safety. Update StrategicCalendar using mandatory CSS variables (hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground). Implement getDailySchedule(date) with bg-muted loading states and proper error handling. Update DailyDashboard to use AppShell wrapper with bg-background text-foreground transitions. Add loading states using chart color variables and error handling with proper contrast ratios. Implement breadcrumb navigation with established spacing patterns (space-y-4 md:space-y-6). Use Framer Motion with established animation variants and CSS variable integration.

# Test Strategy:
Test calendar navigation compiles with established TypeScript configuration and uses mandatory CSS variables. Verify AppShell integration works correctly with responsive patterns. Ensure loading states use chart color variables properly. Test error handling maintains accessibility standards with proper contrast ratios.
